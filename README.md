### Project Description
A revolutionary, absolutely unnecessary device that translates ambient noise into physical vibrations and dramatic light shows, allowing you to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù your neighbor‚Äôs blender, your dog‚Äôs snore, or your roommate‚Äôs emotional K-pop marathon ‚Äî whether you like it or not.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People can hear noise of engine, but can they truly feel it?
We live in a society where sound waves are tragically underutilized. Why let your ears have all the fun when your skin, spine, and soul could be involved too?



### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a system that:

Records real engine noises (or steals them from YouTube).

Processes them into ‚Äúvibration patterns‚Äù using questionable math.

Sends those patterns to vibration motors hidden in a seat cushion.

Lights up an RGB LED strip in sync with the revs, so your eyes can suffer too.
## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- For Software:

Languages: Python, Arduino C++

Frameworks: Flask (for a pointless web UI), Arduino framework

Libraries: PyAudio, FastLED, NumPy, Matplotlib (for graphs no one understands)

Tools: VS Code, GitHub, Audacity

For Hardware:
- Main Components: Arduino Nano, MAX9814 microphone, WS2812B LEDs, 12V vibration motors, motor driver module

Specifications:

Vibration speed: Adjustable from ‚Äúidling‚Äù to ‚Äúdentist drill‚Äù

LEDs: 60 per meter, retina-melting brightness

Microphone: Picks up engine sounds up to 20m away (or through walls, awkwardly)

Tools Required: Soldering iron, zip ties, duct tape, WD-40 (for realism)
